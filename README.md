## Matrices

- [ ] Add complete documentation to `ejovo_matrix.h`
- [ ] Provide more conversion functions between a Matrix and a normal c array
- [ ] Finish Complete testing suite of Matrix.

I might want to add a bitflag to each matrix to be able to keep track of whether or nor it is a transpose, if it's hermitian, symmetric, etc. etc.
